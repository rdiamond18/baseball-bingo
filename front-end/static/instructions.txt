Welcome to Baseball Bingo! Your goal is to try and fill out the following grid using no more than 40 players.
Players will appear above the grid, and you can click on a category to cross it off.  
If you believe the player matches none of the categories, you can select the skip button.
If you incorrectly choose a category, you will lose that player as well as the next player.
Once per game, you can use the Wildcard button, which will select all matching categories on the grid for the player.
